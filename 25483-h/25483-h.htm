<p><span class="smcap">achook</span> of the Chilkats told me these tales
of The Time That Was. But before the telling,
he of the Northland and I of the Southland had
travelled many a mile with dog-team, snowshoes,
and canoe.</p>

<p>If the stories suffer in the telling, as suffer they
must afar from that wondrous Alaskan background
of mountain and forest, glacier and river, wrenched
from the setting of campfires and trail, and divorced
from the soft gutturals and halting throat notes in
which they have been handed down from generation
to generation of Chilkat and Chilkoot, blame not
Zachook, who told them to me, and forbear to blame
me who tell them to you as best I may in this stiff
English tongue. They were many months in the
telling and many weary miles have I had to carry
them in my memory pack.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had lost count of the hours, lost count of the
days that at best are marked by little change between
darkness and dawn in the Northland winter, until I
knew not how long I had lain there in my blanket
of snow, waiting for the lingering feet of that dawdler,
Death, to put an end to my sufferings.</p>

<p>Some hours, or days, or years before I had been
pushing along the trail to the coast, thinking little
where I placed my feet and much of the eating that lay
at Dalton Post House; and of other things thousands of
miles from this bleak waste, where men exist in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
hope of ultimate living, with kaleidoscope death by
their side; other things that had to do with women's
faces, bills of fare from which bacon and beans were
rigidly excluded, and comforts of the flesh that some
day I again might enjoy.</p>

<p>Then, as if to mock me, teach me the folly of
allowing even my thoughts to wander from her cold
face, the Northland meted swift punishment. The
packed snow of the trail beneath my feet gave way,
there was a sharp click of steel meeting steel, and a
shooting pain that ran from heel to head. For a moment
I was sick and giddy from the shock and sudden
pain, then, loosening the pack from my shoulders, fell
to digging the snow with my mittened hands away
from what, even before I uncovered it, I knew to be a
bear trap that had bitten deep into my ankle and held
it in vise clutch. Roundly I cursed at the worse than
fool who had set bear trap in man trail, as I tore
and tugged to free myself. As well might I have
tried to wrench apart the jaws of its intended victim.</p>

<p>Weakened at last by my efforts and the excruciating
pain I lay back upon the snow. A short
rest, and again I pulled feebly at the steel teeth,
until my hands were bleeding and my brain swirling.</p>

<p>How long I struggled blindly, viciously, like a
trapped beaver, I do not know, though I have an
indistinct memory of reaching for my knife to
emulate his sometime method of escape. But with
the first flakes of falling snow came a delicious, contentful
langour, deadening the pain, soothing the
weariness of my muscles, calming the tempest of my
thoughts and fears, and lulling me gently to sleep
to the music of an old song crooned by the breeze
among the trees.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was with that queer feeling
of foreign surroundings we sometimes experience,
and the snow, the forest, the pain in my leg, my
own being, were as strange as the crackling fire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the warm blanket that wrapped me, and the Indian
who bent over me smiling into my half opened eyes.</p>

<p>So were our trails joined and made one; Zachook
of the Northland, and I of the Southland, by him
later called Kitchakahaech, because my tongue moved
as moved our feet on the trail, unceasingly. And
because of this same love of speech in me, and the
limp I bore for memory of the bear trap, for these
and possibly other reasons, and that a man must
have a family to bear his sins, of the Raven was I
christened by Zachook, the Bear, and to the family
of the Raven was I joined.</p>

<p>Orator among his people though he was, Zachook
was no spendthrift of speech. But surly he never
was; his silence was a pleasant silence, a companionable
interchange of unspoken thoughts. Nor did he
need words as I needed them, his eyes, his hands,
his wordless lips could convey whole volumes of
meaning, with lights and shades beyond the power
that prisons thought. Not often did he speak at
length, even to me, unless, as it came to be, he was
moved by some hap or mishap of camp or trail to
tell of the doings of that arch rascal, Yaeethl, the
raven, God, Bird, and Scamp. And when, sitting over
the fire, or with steering paddle in hand, he did open
the gates that lead to the land of legend, he seemed
but to listen and repeat the words of Kahn, the fire
spirit, who stands between the Northland and death,
or of Klingat-on-ootke, God of the Waters, whose
words seemed to glisten on the dripping paddle.</p>

<p>So it was upon an evening in the time when we
had come to be as sons of the same mother, when we
shared pack and blanket and grub alike, and were
known, each to the other, for the men we were. We
had finished our supper of salmon baked in the coals,
crisply fried young grouse and the omnipresent sourdough
bread, and with the content that comes of
well filled stomachs were seated with the fire between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
us, Zachook studying the glowing embers, I with
that friend of solitude, my pipe, murmuring peacefully
in response to my puffing.</p>

<p>As usual, I had been talking, and my words had
run upon the trail of the raven, whose hoarse call
floated up to us from the river. Idly I had spoken,
and disparagingly, until Zachook half smilingly, half
earnestly quoted:</p>

<p>"He who fires in the air without aim may hit a
friend."</p>

<p>And as I relapsed into silence added: "It is
time, Kitchakahaech, that you heard of the head of
your family, this same Yaeethl, the raven. Then will
you have other words for him, though, when you have
heard, it will be for you to speak them as a friend
speaks or as an enemy. Of both has Yaeethl many."</p>

<p>I accepted the rebuke in silence, for Zachook's
trail was longer then mine by many years, and he
had seen and done things which were yet as thoughts
with me.</p>

<p>For the time of the smoking and refilling of my
pipe Zachook was silent, then with eyes gazing deep
into the fire, began:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Before there was a North or South, when Time
was not, Klingatona-Kla, the Earth Mother, was
blind, and all the world was dark. No man had seen
the sun, moon, or stars, for they were kept hidden
by Yakootsekaya-ka, the Wise Man. Locked in a
great chest were they, in a chest that stood in the
corner of the lodge of the Wise Man, in Tskekowani,
the place that always was and ever will be. Carefully
were they guarded, many locks had the chest,
curious, secret locks, beyond the fingers of a thief.
To outwit the cunning of Yaeethl were the locks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
made. Yaeethl the God, Yaeethl the Raven, Yaeethl
the Great Thief, of whom the Wise Man was most
afraid.</p>

<p>"The Earth Mother needed light that her eyes
might be opened, that she might bear children and
escape the disgrace of her barrenness. To Yaeethl
the Clever, Yaeethl the Cunning, went Klingatona-Kla,
weeping, and of the Raven begged aid. And Yaeethl
took pity on her and promised that she should have
Kayah, the Light, to father her children.</p>

<p>"Many times had Yaeethl, because of his promise,
tried to steal the Worlds of Light, and as many times
had he failed. But with each attempt his desire grew,
grew until it filled his belly and his brain.</p>

<p>"Was he not Yaeethl, the Great White Raven,
the Father of Thieves? What if the Wise Man put
new and heavier locks upon the chest after each attempt?
Were locks greater than the cunning of the
Raven?</p>

<p>"Now Yakootsekaya-ka, the Wise Man, and his
wife had a daughter. Of their marriage was she, a
young girl, beautiful and good. No man had ever
seen her face. On no one, god or man, had the eyes
of the young girl ever rested, save only her father
and mother, the Wise Ones. Ye-see-et, a virgin, was
she.</p>

<p>"Yaeethl, of his wisdom knowing that the weakness
of men is the strength of children, that a babe
may enter where a warrior may not cast his shadow,
bethought him of this virgin, this daughter of Yakootsekaya-ka.
As the thought and its children made
camp in his brain Yaeethl spread wide his snow-white
wings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 175px;">
<a href="images/i007.jpg"><img src="images/i007tn.jpg" width="175" height="273" class="plain" alt="Raven" title="Raven" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Thrice he circled high in air, then took flight
towards Tskekowani, the meeting place of Memory
and Hope. Like Chunet, the Arrow, he flew, straight,
and as Heen, the River, swift. Twice ten moons, and
another, flew Yaeethl without rest of wing before he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
drew near the cabin of the Wise Man. Away from
the lodge he alighted, by the edge of the spring were
his white wings folded, by the spring where the
daughter of the Wise Man would come for water.</p>

<p>"Then, with the power that was his, Yaeethl, the
God, changed the shape that was his, the shape of the
raven; into a small white pebble did he change, and
lay in the water of the spring, and in the water
waited for the coming of the girl.</p>

<p>"Long waited Yaeethl, the Pebble, with the
patience of wisdom and great desire. And the girl
came.</p>

<p>"Beautiful in her maidenhood, graceful in the
dawning of her womanhood, came the girl, the virgin,
the daughter of Yakootsekaya-ka, the Keeper of the
Worlds of Light. Stooping, she dipped her cup into
the cool water. From the edge of the spring rolled
Yaeethl, into the cup he rolled, and lay quiet in the
shadow of her hand. Quiet he lay, but full of the
Great Desire.</p>

<p>"And the girl saw him not.</p>

<p>"To the lodge returned the maiden, bearing the
cup, the water, and the Pebble. Into the lodge entered
the maiden. In the lodge where lay the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, was Yaeethl.</p>

<p>"From the cup the Wise Man drank, but Yaeethl
moved not. From the cup the Mother drank, and
Yaeethl was motionless. When the Daughter raised
the cup to her lips, toward her lips rolled Yaeethl.
Softly he rolled, but the Mother, ever careful, heard
the sound of the pebble on the cup-side, and the keen
eyes of the Father saw the white pebble shine.</p>

<p>"'Do not drink, Daughter,' said the Wise Man,
laying his hand on the maiden's arm. 'Small things
sometimes contain great evils. A white pebble it may
be, and only a white pebble. Yaeethl it may be,
Yaeethl the Raven, Yaeethl the Father of Thieves.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<a href="images/i008.jpg"><img src="images/i008tn.jpg" width="175" height="267" class="plain" alt="Locked chest" title="Locked chest" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Then the Mother took the cup and out through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the door cast the water. Through the door cast the
pebble. And when the door of the lodge was closed
behind him Yaeethl, the Disappointed, once more took
his own form, the shape of the raven, white of wing
and white of feather.</p>

<p>"Back to earth flew Yaeethl, angry, ashamed, but
more than ever filled with a great longing for the
Worlds of Light that lay locked in the chest of the
Wise Man.</p>

<p>"Klingatona-Kla, Earth Mother, wept long and
sore when empty-handed returned Yaeethl, loud she
wailed, making sure she must remain forever dark
and barren. But Yaeethl, the Undaunted, comforted
her with strong words, and renewed his promise that
the Light should be given her in marriage, and her
disgrace forgotten in many children, children should
she have as the shore has sand.</p>

<p>"Though he had flown as speeds Hoon, the North
Wind, the going and coming of Yaeethl had eaten
three winters and two summers.</p>

<p>"Awhile he rested in the lap of Klingatona-Kla,
for the winter he rested, but with the coming of
the spring, he spread again his wings and took flight
towards the lodge of the Wise Man, towards the
Great Desire. Mightily he flew, and swift, for though
the dead make the journey between the opening and
the closing of an eye, for the living it is a long trail.</p>

<p>"When again he alighted, wing weary, by the
spring where the daughter of Yakootsekaya-ka drew
water, Yaeethl remembered the shape and whiteness
that had betrayed him, remembered the traitor Pebble,
and from the memory gathered wisdom.</p>

<p>"Close to his side folded he the wings of whiteness,
beneath his feathers tucked head and feet, and
grew small. Small and yet smaller he grew, as melts ice
before the fire, and when the shrinking was ended he
had taken upon himself the form of Thlay-oo, the sand
grain. As Thlay-oo, the Little, he waited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"As Thlay-oo, the Invisible, watched Yaeethl for
the coming of the maiden. Waited as does the bear
for the coming of Takeete, the After Winter. Watched
as does the lynx for the young caribou.</p>

<p>"And as before came the girl, cup in hand, innocent
in her maidenhood, wise in her womanhood, in
both beautiful. Gracefully she stooped and filled the
cup with the water of the spring. Into the cup floated
Yaeethl in the shape of Thlay-oo. In the spring water
he sank and lay against the bottom of the cup. Small
was Yaeethl, but big with desire for what was within
the chest of the Wise Man.</p>

<p>"Then the lodge door opened and received the
maiden and the cup, received Yaeethl the Grain of
Sand, Yaeethl the Raven.</p>

<p>"To Yakootsekaya-ka, her father, the girl gave
the cup, and the Wise Man drank of the water. Drank,
but saw not Yaeethl, the Invisible. To the wife, her
mother, the maiden gave the cup, and of the water
the Mother drank. Drank, but heard not Yaeethl, the
Still. Then the maiden, Ye-see-et, the Virgin, daughter
of Yakootsekaya-ka, the Keeper of the Sun, Moon,
and Stars, lifted the cup to her lips.</p>

<p>"The Mother spoke not. The Father moved not.
The Daughter drank.</p>

<p>"Past the red of her lips, by the white of her
teeth, down the throat of the girl rolled the grain of
sand. Rolled until it lay close under her heart, and
paused. Under the heart of the maiden lay Yaeethl,
waited Yaeethl, grew Yaeethl. Warmed by the heart
of the maiden Yaeethl grew.</p>

<p>"And time passed.</p>

<p>"Then the mother of the maiden, looking upon
her daughter, became troubled in her mind. Troubled
was the mind of the Mother, but silent her tongue.</p>

<p>"And time passed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<a href="images/i010.jpg"><img src="images/i010tn.jpg" width="175" height="264" class="plain" alt="Girl filling cup with water" title="Gril filling cup with water" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Again the Mother looked upon her daughter, and
looking, spoke<!--**changed 'Spoke' to 'spoke'--> to the Wise Man, her husband, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
thought that was hers. Spoke she of the troubled
thought concerning the maiden, their daughter.</p>

<p>"When the Mother's thought was the thought of
the Father his heart was filled with anger at his
daughter for the disgrace she would bring upon his
name. Angrily he questioned her, that he might revenge
himself upon the thief of her innocence. But
the girl looked into the eyes of her father and denied
both thief and theft. No man had she seen save him,
her father. Of the cause of The Thought that troubled
them was she ignorant, and as innocent as ignorant.
And the truth shone from her eyes as she
spoke, straight was her tongue. Empty of shame was
her face.</p>

<p>"And the Mother, looking into the eyes of her
daughter, believed. And after a time was the Wise
Man convinced. Yet troubled were they and lost upon
the trail of thoughts. Tender had they always been
of their daughter. Ten times as gentle were they
now, for Yaeethl lay big under the heart of the girl,
though they knew him not, and of their love was
she in sore need.</p>

<p>"And time passed.</p>

<p>"Then upon the maiden came Kod-se-tee, the
Woman Pain, and Yaeethl entered the lodge.</p>

<p>"Yaeethl whom they knew not, Yaeethl the Boy
in the maiden's arms. Tokanay, the Baby, they called
him, with love-light in their eyes they named him.
Strong and large grew he quickly. So quickly grew
he that the maiden and her mother were in a valley
between the mountain of pride and the mountain of
wonder. And in the Wise Man's heart flowed a great
river of love for Tokanay the Beautiful, Tokanay the
Swift Growing. In the hands of the Boy were the
three hearts held. Their eyes and their thoughts were
filled with him, so that room for other things there
was not. So was the locked chest and its contents
forgotten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then on a day, a day of days to the Three, the
Boy spoke his first word.</p>

<p>"'Kakoon.'</p>

<p>"Kakoon, the Sun, was the word, and 'Kakoon,
Kakoon, Kakoon,' said the boy, crying and stretching
his arms toward the chest in the corner of the lodge.</p>

<p>"The Wise Man listened and laughing said: 'He
would take my place as Keeper of the Worlds of
Light.' Then because his heart was so soft with love
that he could refuse the Boy nothing, Yakootsekaya-ka
undid the many curious locks and fastenings of the
great chest and took out the Sun.</p>

<p>"Kakoon, the Sun, he took and gave it to the
Boy wherewith to play. And the Boy ceased his crying
when the Sun was in his hands, laughing as he
rolled the Yellow World about the floor of the lodge.
All day did the Three watch him with loving eyes.</p>

<p>"On the next day the Sun lay in a corner of the
lodge, unheeded by the Boy. A new word had he
learned:</p>

<p>"'Dis-s.'</p>

<p>"Dis-s, the Moon, was the second word, and as
before, 'Dis-s, Dis-s,' cried the Boy.</p>

<p>"Proudly and lovingly the Wise Man laughed,
saying: 'Surely is he eager to take my place.' And
from the moving of the love in his heart that answered
to the cry of the Boy as arrow to bowstring,
Yakootsekaya-ka unfastened the strong and heavy
locks of the chest and into the hands of the Boy
gave the Moon for plaything. Of Dis-s, the Moon,
made he plaything for the Boy. And for that day
were the Boy's cries hushed as he spun and tumbled
the White World on the lodge floor. And his laughter
was music to the ears of the Three.</p>

<p>"But the next day the Moon lay with the Sun.
In the corner they lay and the Boy looked not at
them. Another word was his cry, a new word.</p>

<p>"'Takhonaha."</p>

<p>"Takhonaha, the Stars, was the cry of the Boy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and again, to comfort him, the Wise Man opened the
great chest, and from it poured the Stars into the
lap of the Boy, poured the chest empty of the Worlds
of Light. And the Boy laughed loud. Laughed until
the Wise Man, the Wife, and the Maiden, his mother,
laughed that he laughed, as he dripped the bright
stars through his fingers, dripped the waterfall of
stars. Then the Wise Man questioned as he laughed:
'What shall he cry for tomorrow? And what shall
we give him, the Unsatisfied, now that the chest is
empty?'</p>

<p>"And the Boy laughed.</p>

<p>"Night came, and the Wise Man, and his Wife,
and the Maiden-Mother, their daughter, slept. With
Tokanay, the Baby, in the hollow of her arm slept
the girl.</p>

<p>"As they slept, from the hollow of the arm of the
maiden there crept a raven, Yaeethl the Raven, Yaeethl
the Snow-White, Yaeethl the Father of Thieves.</p>

<p>"Softly crept he, with many times turned head
and watchful eye on the Three, sleeping. To the corner
where the Boy, careless, had dropped the Shining
Worlds, to the corner by the open, empty chest crept
Yaeethl the Noiseless.</p>

<p>"And the Three slept.<!--**removed extra. --></p>

<p>"Beneath his right wing hid Yaeethl the Sun.
Beneath his left wing hid he the Moon. Within his
claws gathered he the Stars.</p>

<p>"Asleep were the Three.</p>

<p>"The lodge door was closed, locked was the door
of Yakootsekaya-ka, Keeper of the Worlds of Light.
Fastened tight were the windows. Barred were door
and windows to keep out Yaeethl, the Thief. For a
moment stood Yaeethl, turning his head to find some
hole through which he might escape, then toward the
wide chimney he flew.</p>

<p>"Still slept the Three.</p>

<p>"Wide spread were the wings of Yaeethl, the
Flying, and the great light of the Sun was uncovered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Brightly it shone, straight into the eyes of the Wise
Man gleamed the fierce light.</p>

<p>"Awake was Yakootsekaya-ka, crying: 'Yaeethl!
Yaeethl! 'Tis Yaeethl! Awake!'</p>

<p>"Awake was the Wife and the Daughter, and the
Three strove to catch the Raven, the White One. But
the great light of the Sun was in their eyes and they
were blinded so they fell in each other's way. And
in the throat of the chimney was Yaeethl, flying upward.</p>

<p>"Then did the Wise Man call upon Kahn, his
sister's son, Kahn, the God of Fire, to aid him. Up
blazed Kahn and tried to catch Yaeethl, the Fleeing,
in his red teeth, but near the top of the chimney was
Yaeethl, so that the teeth of Kahn could not reach
him.</p>

<p>"Then Kahn called upon the Wise Man to blow,
and the Wise Man puffed out his cheeks and blew
with full lungs, and by his blowing Kahn stretched
high his long black arms and tightly curled them
about the White Raven.</p>

<p>"Then did Yaeethl, the Strong of Wing, struggle
mightily. Against Kahn, the Fire God, did he struggle,
beating with his white wings. Long did they struggle,
until from the lungs of the Wise Man was the breath
gone, and the arms of the Fire God, the smoke arms,
grew thin and weak.</p>

<p>"With his wings beat Yaeethl, breaking the hold
of the smoke arms, Yaeethl the Free, Yaeethl the Ever
Black One.</p>

<p>"Forever were the wings and feathers of the Raven
blackened by the smoke arms of Kahn, the God of
Fire.</p>

<p>"Back toward Klingatona-Kla, the Earth Mother,
the Barren, flew Yaeethl holding tight the Sun, Moon,
and Stars. But after him came the Wise Man, full
of anger. And the Shining Worlds grew heavy.
Heavy was the pack of Yaeethl, and weary his wings.
Afar off was Klingatona-Kla.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then did Yaeethl, the Pursued, Yaeethl the
Heavy Laden, cast from him Kakoon, the Sun. To
the east threw he the Sun, and flew on.</p>

<p>"Again did the Wise Man come close behind, and
again did Yaeethl ease his burden. From him threw
he Dis-s, the Moon. To the West cast he the Moon.</p>

<p>"Then was Yakootsekaya-ka left behind for a
time, but the Raven weary and burdened, flew slowly,
and once again he felt the breath of the Wise Man
ruffle his feathers. No time had Yaeethl to stop, on
nothing could he rest.</p>

<p>"Opened he his claws and scattered wide the
Stars. To North and South fell Takhonaha, the Stars,
to East and West fell they.</p>

<p>"Then was the promise of Yaeethl fulfilled. Thus
kept he his word to the Earth Mother, and gave her
light, that she might see. Gave her Kayah, the Light,
to father her children and wipe out the disgrace of
her barrenness. And the children of Klingatona-Kla
were as the sands of the sea.</p>

<p>"But upon Yaeethl, the Raven, had fallen the
curses of the Wise Man. Three curses: Blackness,
Hoarseness, and the Keeping of One Shape. And as
his feathers were blackened, so, thereafter, was his
heart darkened with eternal selfishness."</p></div>

<p>I was silent. My pipe had gone out, and Zachook
was bent low over the dying fire. I was thinking of
another story of a Child who had given Light to the
World, and suffered for the bringing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hank</span> Yaeethl for that," said Zachook as I
rose with dripping beard from the stream
where I had drunk deep, with many sighs of satisfaction
and relief. "His pack is not heavy with
thanks of men these days."</p>

<p>"Thank the Raven? For what?"</p>

<p>"The starving man asks not the name of the
owner of the cache, but his heart is filled with
gratitude."</p>

<p>"That may be, but no cache of Yaeethl's is in
this stream."</p>

<p>"The ignorant deny all they cannot see."</p>

<p>"Wise sayings feed neither fire nor belly," I
retorted, provoked by the criticism of my companion,
thinly veiled behind his customary proverbs,
and attempting to pay him in his own coin from my
slender store of Klingat adages. "'Only a beggar
gives thanks.'<!--removed end quotes--> Is it not your teaching that he who

here? If Yaeethl wants my thanks, if they are the
due of the Raven, he has them, but why or for what
I know not. Your words are like the ice of a
windy day, rough and cloudy."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>The next world.</i></p></div>

<p>"You are right, Cousin. I forget at times that
you are only a white man. Let me touch thy ear
with my tongue."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cha-auk.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In the Time before Time, there was
no water upon the earth or in the bowl of the sea,
and Shanagoose the Sky gave neither rain nor snow.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> <i>Ages ago.</i></p></div>

<p>"In one place only was Heen, the water. In a
deep well it was, the father of wells, hidden among
the mountains that lie between here and Tskekowani.</p>

<p>"To Heenhadowa, the Thirst Spirit, belonged the
well, by Heenhadowa was it guarded. By the door of
the well-house sat he by day, in front of the well-house
door was his bed by night. And none might
enter.</p>

<p>"Never did he leave the well, morning, noon
or night. From the water he took life, to the water
he gave life. To no man, woman, or child, to neither
animal nor bird, to nothing that walks, creeps, or
flies would Heenhadowa give of the precious water.
Not so much as would moisten the tongue of Ta-ka
the Mosquito would he give, though men died.</p>

<p>"To quench their thirst men chewed the roots
of young trees and the stalk of Yan-a-ate.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> <i>Species of wild celery.</i></p></div>

<p>"A few men there were, brave of heart and
moose-legged, who had travelled the weary journey
to the well among the mountains, the mountains
marked with the trail of Oonah, the Gray One,
Death, seeking the water that is life.</p>

<p>"And of them?</p>

<p>"Is it not well said that Oonah, Death, and Koo-stay,
Life, are brothers, and he who seeks one finds the
other?</p>

<p>"And Heenhadowa laughed, first at their black
lips, later at their white bones, and drank deep but
gave not.</p>

<p>"Now Yaeethl, the Raven, Desirer of All Things,
longed most for those that were forbidden, concealed,
or like the favor of women, not to be had
for the asking. And since the water was denied,
his tongue ached with dryness, and Yan-a-ate lost
its savor. Also was his heart moved by the prayers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of men and the cries of women. But his tongue
troubled him more than did his heart, his tongue
and his cupidity, so that he was moved to try his
cunning where the strength and bravery of men had
failed.</p>

<p>"No crooked trail through forests and over mountains
had Yaeethl to measure with his feet, but on
his wings of blackness was he borne straight to the
place of the well.</p>

<p>"Well and well-house he found, found also
Heenhadowa, watchful, moving not from his place.
As one greets an old friend new found spoke Yaeethl
to the Thirst Spirit. With smooth tongue and soft
words spoke the Raven, claiming kinship through
the cousin of his grandmother's grandmother. Said
also that when he left his father's country he was
bidden seek that old and true friend of the family,
Heenhadowa the Wise, the Generous Giver of Water.
As bidden, so had he obeyed and flown straight
without halt or rest to bow before his mighty relative,
and taste of his wonderful well, the like of
which not even his father had, who possessed all
things.</p>

<p>"But the Maker of Thirst laughed at the Raven
and mocked him, bidding him, if he would drink,
find or dig a well of his own.</p>

<p>"Again Yaeethl recounted their connected lineage,
from mother to mother's mother, from family
to family and tribe to tribe, tied with proof and
argument, lashed with meek bows, and smoothed
with soft flattery.</p>

<p>"Heenhadowa laughed scornfully, cast from him
the claim of cousinship, and mocked at Yaeethl's
tongue, dry from the dust of many words.</p>

<p>"Then Yaeethl drew about him the parka of anger
and answered scorn with scorn, mockery with mockery,
and laughter with laughter.</p>

<p>"In his father's country, said Yaeethl, they gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the name of Heenhadowa to mangy dogs and unclean
women. Glad was the heart of Yaeethl that the Thirst
Spirit denied the relationship he had laid as a snare,
the denial would make his father proud. As for the
well, 'twas now known to the most stupid, even to
men, that it was but an empty hole in the ground,
covered by the well-house to hide the dryness thereof,
and no deeper than Kaelt-tay, the Seagull,
scratches in the sand for nesting.</p>

<p>"Laughed Heenhadowa again, saying that belief
or unbelief of Raven or man lessened not his treasure
by a drop.</p>

<p>"Then Yaeethl's words flared as firesparks.
Hot words of evil sounding names, vile as only the
brain of Yaeethl could fashion, taunts that bit and
stung festeringly like the nettles of Sech-ut,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> names
that would disgrace the family of a Siwash, callings
that would make even a squaw-man hang his head
in shame. Can I say more of the bitterness of the
tongue of Yaeethl?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> <i>Devil's Club.</i></p></div>

<p>"Heenhadowa laughed.</p>

<p>"To battle Yaeethl challenged the Thirst Spirit:
'Come forth and meet me, you fatherless son of a
shameless mother, littering of a slave's slave.</p>

<p>"'Come with me to the plain below and I will
make of thy blood another well, for another of thy
family of dogs to guard.'</p>

<p>"Flatteries and arguments, insults and challenges
fell into the same echoless hole, bringing to Yaeethl
only the laughter of Heenhadowa and increase of
thirst.</p>

<p>"Then was the heart of Yaeethl heavy within
him, but not so heavy as his face said, for it is not
the way of the Raven to eat quickly of discouragement,
though he turned and left the well and its
guardian like a gambler who has lost his last blanket.</p>

<p>"Not far did he go. Only so far as to be hidden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
from the eyes of Heenhadowa, where silence might
mother the children of his brain. And since the
brain of the Raven is full of the seeds of cunning a
plan was quickly born.</p>

<p>"Back toward the well flew Yaeethl, but, since
he who sees the tail of a lone wolf imagines the
whole pack, he alighted at a distance where the
eyes of Heenhadowa saw as one sees in a fog. A
space the size a man uses for his lodge he cleared
of all bushes and weeds, to the smallest blade of
grass he cleared it of everything that grew.</p>

<p>"When the space was as the palm of a man's
hand the Raven spread his wings until every feather
showed and, first bowing low to Hoon-nach, Yunda-haech,
Sa-nach, and Deckta-haech,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who guard the
four corners of the earth, walked slowly around the
sides three times, at every third step stopping and
making strange motions and stranger sounds, as
does an Icht<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> when he would drive the evil spirits
away.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> <i>North, East, South and West.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> <i>Witch Doctor.</i></p></div>

<p>"From each corner he took a stone and spat
upon it and cast it over his shoulder, and in the
dust drew the shapes of animals like unto rolled
deer-thongs, animals with two tongues such as no
man has seen upon earth.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> <i>Snakes are unknown in Alaska.</i></p></div>

<p>"To the space Yaeethl dragged logs and laid
them end across end and bottom on top. As each
tier was laid he sang words in a strange language,
and as he sang, spat upon and cast pebbles over his
shoulder as before.</p>

<p>"But toward Heenhadowa were the eyes and
tongue of Yaeethl the eyes of the blind and the tongue
of the dumb. Busily he worked and loudly sang his
charms, but to the Thirst Spirit he gave neither look
nor word.</p>

<p>"On Yaeethl were the eyes of Heenhadowa fastened,
strained were his eyes, watching the doings
of the Raven, wide his ears to catch the words of
the songs and charms.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 175px;">
<a href="images/i021.jpg"><img src="images/i021tn.jpg" width="175" height="262" class="plain" alt="Raven" title="Raven" /></a>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"When the roof was on and the house finished
to the last piece of moss between the logs, Yaeethl
again circled it three times, bowed again to the
guardians of the earth's ends, and without looking
behind, entered the lodge and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Curiosity filled eyes and ears, heart and belly
of Heenhadowa. Though he had lived since the Beginning,
never before had he seen what that day he
had seen, never had his ears been greeted with such
words and songs.</p>

<p>"And to Heenhadowa the inside of the lodge
was the pack, as was the outside the lone wolf tail.</p>

<p>"Even so had Yaeethl planned, nor was that
the end of the cunning of the Raven, who knew
that no door can bar the going in of curiosity.</p>

<p>"Long sat Heenhadowa before the door of his
well-house, gazing at the lodge of Yaeethl. And the
longer he sat and the longer he gazed the keener
grew his desire to see what was hidden from his
eyes by the walls and closed door, grew until it
tortured him as the thirsty are tortured, beyond endurance.</p>

<p>"And Heenhadowa rose from his seat by the
well.</p>

<p>"From the place where he had sat for ages
rose the Thirst Spirit and stepped softly. Toward
the closed door he moved as moves one who is pulled
at the end of a thong, for the fear of the unknown
was upon him. But stronger than his fear was his
desire to know what lay behind the door, stronger
even than his fear of those strange animals that were
drawn in the dust, dust pictures that made his
blood ice.</p>

<p>"Before the door he stopped and glanced back
the way he had come, at his well and well-house he
looked, then pushing against the door with his hand,
stepped within the house builded by Yaeethl, made
by Yaeethl the Raven, Yaeethl the Cunning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"No man knows what Heenhadowa found within
the lodge of the Raven. Only this we know.</p>

<p>"When the time of the boiling of a salmon had
passed, from the door stepped Yaeethl walking as
a man walks who has been carrying a heavy pack.
Behind him he closed the door and against it rolled
a heavy stone, a stone so heavy that not even K'hoots
the Grizzly, the Strong One, could have moved it
away again.</p>

<p>"Within the lodge was silence, silence big with
unborn noise.</p>

<p>"To the well of Heenhadowa, the father of wells
among the mountains, the well untasted of man or
beast, flew Yaeethl, Yaeethl the Desirer of All
Things.</p>

<p>"And when the Raven stood beside the well he
bowed his head and drank.</p>

<p>"Some say that it took him many moons, some
put it the length of a man's life, but, long time or
short time, when the head of Yaeethl the Raven was
lifted the well was dry.</p>

<p>"Of water there was none in the well of Heenhadowa.</p>

<p>"In the belly and mouth of the Raven was the
water. All.</p>

<p>"Then did Yaeethl spread wide his wings of
blackness and fly the way of his coming.</p>

<p>"As he flew over the bosom of Klingatona-Kla,
the Earth Mother, in this place and in that he spat
out some of the water. And where spat the Raven
there sprang up streams, and rivers, and lakes.</p>

<p>"When he had flown so long and so far that
the water was gone from his mouth, and in his
belly was not fresh, then from his belly and his
mouth he cast it, salt, and Athlch, the Ocean, was."</p>

<p>I waited silently, for there was an uplift in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Zachook's voice that made me think there was more
to follow, but it was only:</p>

<p>"If you listen to the words of them that know
not, they will tell you that Haechlt is a great bird
the falling of whose eyelids makes thunder, the flashing
of whose eye is the lightning, but if my words
be the words of truth, then is thunder the angry
voice of Heenhadowa whom Yaeethl made prisoner,
and lightning the cracks in the lodge walls when he
throws himself against them, struggling to be free.
Should he succeed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, bird or Thirst Spirit, from Yaeethl is the
gift of water. So say I again&mdash;&mdash;when you drink,
give thanks to the Raven that chewed roots are not the
answer to thy dry lips,&mdash;give thanks, and pray that
the rock rolls not away."</p>

<p>And I gave thanks, quoting to myself another
of Zachook's sayings, "Better a wasted arrow than
lost game."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">achook</span>, with a half amused, half sympathetic
smile at my futile efforts to slaughter a small
percentage of the mosquito cloud that enveloped us,
made a smudge of leaves, and I willingly exchanged
the tortures of being eaten alive for those of slow
strangulation in the acrid smoke.</p>

<p>My remarks had been neither calm nor patient,
consisting mainly of my entire vocabulary of opprobrious
adjectives and epithets several times repeated
and diversified, aided by a wide, but wholly inadequate,
range of profanity in the various languages
at my command. And, to digress slightly, I would
recommend the study of Arabic and Spanish to those
feeling a similar need; they do not meet all requirements
of forcible expression, but they add some wonderful
flights of imagination to the more practical
English expletives.</p>

<p>Zachook was apparently as unimpressed as the
mosquitoes, but when I had recovered some portion of
my breath and equanimity,<!--**changed 'equinimity' to 'equanimity'--> remarked: "He who
shoots with his tongue should be careful of his aim."</p>

<p>Choking with anger and smoke I could only
splutter in reply, while Zachook continued:</p>

<p>"Ta-ka is Ta-ka, and Yaeethl is Yaeethl."</p>

<p>"What has the Raven to do with these insufferable
pests? Has he not enough to answer for
without linking his name with these suckers of
blood? Yaeethl is Yaeethl, but Ta-ka is Ta-ka."</p>

<p>"Yaeethl or Ta-ka. The get of the Raven are
ravens, and from Yaeethl comes Ta-ka the Biter.</p>

<p>"When the selfishness of men had driven the
gods from the earth, the Great Ones held a council
in Tskekowani, a potlach in the World Beyond. All
the gods were there. They talked of the sins of men
and of the punishments that should be visited upon
them. Long they talked.</p>

<p>"Then Theunghow, Chief of Gods, called each
by name, and bade him name his sending.</p>

<p>"And each god named a sickness, a pain, or a
killing.</p>

<p>"At one side stood Oonah the Death Shadow,
and in his hand held his quiver. And as each punishment
was named, into his quiver placed Oonah
an arrow, sharp-pointed, swift-flying, death-carrying.</p>

<p>"The quiver was full, and all had spoken, all
save Yaeethl the Raven, who by the cook pot sat
smiling, eating.</p>

<p>"To Yaeethl spoke K'hoots the Grizzly, saying:</p>

<p>"'Dost thou send nothing, Brother? Behold,
the Quiver of Death is full, and from the Raven is
there no arrow of punishment for men. What arrow
gives Yaeethl?'</p>

<p>"'Why bother me when I am eating? Is there
not time after the pot is empty? Many arrows
there are. Because men insult me shall gods spoil
my eating?' Thus spoke the Raven as he scraped the
pot.</p>

<p>"Then Hckt the Frog urged, saying:</p>

<p>"'Art thou a god, or is thy belly a god, that in
the council the Raven takes no part?'</p>

<p>"'A god am I, and a god have I been since the
Beginning, thou son of wind and slime. But that
my ears may be no longer troubled, a little punishment
will I send, that the sons of men forget
me not. No arrow from Yaeethl shall find place
in Oonah's quiver. Arrow and messenger both will
I send. Thy punishments carry the peace of death,
mine the torment of life.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"'And this punishment of thine?' asked Hckt,
sneering.</p>

<p>"And Yaeethl, as from the pot he cleaned the
last morsel, replied:</p>

<p>"'Ta-ka.'</p>

<p>"Of all the punishments named by the gods,
the first to reach the earth was that of Yaeethl,&mdash;Ta-ka
the Mosquito.</p>

<p>"To Khandatagoot the Woodpecker, the simple-minded,
went Ta-ka, and from the Woodpecker
claimed hospitality. And the rights of a stranger
gave Khandatagoot to Ta-ka, gave him a place by
the fire, and of his food a share, for his head a
shelter, treating him as the son of a sister is treated.
Together they fished and hunted, together they ate
and slept. Of the hunting and fishing the chief
part was Khandatagoot's, of the eating and sleeping
Ta-ka's, Ta-ka who from Yaeethl came.</p>

<p>"On a morning the Woodpecker fixed his canoe,
and alone to the hunt went the Mosquito.</p>

<p>"All day was Ta-ka gone. Low hung the sun
when to camp he returned. Slow flying came the
Mosquito, and as blood is red, so was the body of
Ta-ka, and swelled mightily.</p>

<p>"Then was the Woodpecker frightened, thinking
his friend wounded, and crying, ran to help him.
To the ground sank Ta-ka, but no wound could
Khandatagoot find.</p>

<p>"Many questions asked the Woodpecker, and
to them Ta-ka replied:</p>

<p>"'No hurt have I, but full is my belly, full of
the choicest eating that ever made potlach. Yet
much did I leave behind, the feasting of many
months did I leave.'</p>

<p>"Then was the belly of Khandatagoot pinched
with hunger for this good eating, and of Ta-ka
claimed his share.</p>

<p>"On the tongue of the Woodpecker placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Ta-ka a drop, saying: 'No more can I give of what
I have eaten, but as you have shared with me, so
shall I share with you. The fill of many bellies is
there left.'</p>

<p>"'Where is this sweet eating?' asked Khandatagoot,
'Tell me the trail that I too may feast until
my wings are heavy.'</p>

<p>"'No trail is there, Brother. The red juice of
a dead tree is this eating, a dead tree in the forest.
It's name I know not, but hunt, and you shall find
it. Go quickly, lest others get there first.'"<!--added close quote--></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"And since then," said Zachook, throwing another
handful of leaves on the fire, "since then the
Woodpecker spends his days seeking in dead trees
the red juice that flows in the veins of live men."</p>
